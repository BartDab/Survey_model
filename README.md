# Survey_model
Project made for bachelor thesis, already in progress. It'll be random forest model to predict if student/graduate works in area connected with field of study.
**survey_cleaning.Rmd** includes data cleaning and reorganising, while in **survey_model.Rmd** there are my attempts to make the most accurate and useful model.
